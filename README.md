# Desi Digest

**Desi Digest** is a culturally intelligent HealthTech web app built for South Asian and Bangladeshi food nutrition tracking. We noticed that most nutrition tools are heavily biased toward Western diets and packaged foods, leaving our users guessing the nutritional value of *bhat, dal, mach, shak,* and *vorta*. 

Desi Digest solves this by offering a deeply familiar, practical, and highly visual experience, powered by **Nanumoni**—our warm, AI-driven nutrition companion.

## 🌟 What We've Built (Key Features)

We’ve packed Desi Digest with features designed specifically for the South Asian lifestyle, balancing cutting-edge AI with strict health-safety guardrails:

*   **Culturally Aware Nutrition Tracking:** A localized database and parser that understands Banglish (e.g., estimating macros accurately for a typed meal like "gorur mangsho dim vat").
*   **Photo-Based Plate Analyzer:** Snap a picture of your plate, and Nanumoni will estimate the ingredients, portion sizes, and give you a health score along with actionable feedback.
*   **Smart Health Nudges:** Highly personalized, culturally relevant daily nudges (available in both Bangla and English). The system detects missing fiber, low hydration, or imbalanced rice portions from your logs and offers friendly, non-medical advice.
*   **Raw Food Basket Bridge:** Turn your nutrition advice directly into a practical shopping list for your local *kacha bazar*. It's a smart, zero-checkout bridge to help you gather healthy ingredients.
*   **Shops Near You (Local Discovery):** A privacy-first local discovery map that connects you to nearby public markets, wholesale *arots*, and grocery stores using Google Maps, helping you source fresh, healthy food.
*   **Nanumoni AI Chat:** A conversational assistant that explains nutrition, retrieves your meal data, and offers healthy recipe ideas without ever making unsafe medical claims.
*   **Dashboard & Progress Tracking:** Beautiful macro rings (Calories, Protein, Fiber, Water), daily streaks, and recent meal histories.
*   **Shareable PDF Doctor Reports:** Instantly generate and export your 7-day nutrition summary as a PDF, or share a quick text summary directly via WhatsApp with your doctor or family.
*   **Judge Demo Mode:** A seamless, offline-safe demo experience that allows users to test the app's full capabilities without needing a database login or API keys.

## Stage-4 vision model release

Stage-4 adds a 27-class Bangladeshi food vision adapter built on [Qwen/Qwen3-VL-2B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-VL-2B-Instruct). The final LoRA/QLoRA adapter is [`models/stage4_27class`](./models/stage4_27class).

| Metric | Result |
| --- | ---: |
| Overall validation accuracy | 90.86% |
| Macro accuracy | 89.09% |
| Existing 19-food accuracy | 90.42% |
| PithaNet 8-class accuracy | 91.64% |
| Held-out validation images | 996 |

The final selected model is **checkpoint-645**. The repository includes only its ~18 MB inference adapter, reproducibility metadata, and aggregate results. It does not include raw food images, dataset archives, manifests, base-model weights, intermediate checkpoints, or training state.

See [Stage-4 results](./docs/STAGE4_RESULTS.md), [reproduction notes](./docs/TRAINING_REPRODUCTION.md), and the [dataset and permission note](./docs/DATASET_AND_PERMISSION.md).
